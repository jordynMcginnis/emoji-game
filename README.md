This is a fun emoji game that I built that can handle 4 - 8 players per game. The user is allowed to create a game and choose which game they would like to join. Once the user has selected the game, the user is entered into a queue until all players have joined the game. Once all players have joined the game, the game begins by randomly selecting a player to try and describe a word to their team only using emojis!
